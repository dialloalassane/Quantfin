# Quantfin – Systematic Trading Research

## 📌 Overview

**Quantfin** is a personal research repository dedicated to the implementation and testing of **data-driven systematic trading algorithms**.
The aim is to explore, reproduce, and extend advanced trading strategies from academic and industry research, with a focus on **high-frequency trading (HFT)** and **AI-driven market models**.

## 🎯 Research Interests

This repository covers strategies and models built using cutting-edge machine learning and data science techniques, including:

* **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** – adaptive trading agents that learn from market interactions.
* **Deep Learning (DL)** – neural architectures for time series forecasting, volatility modeling, and order book prediction.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – sentiment analysis and news-based trading.
* **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** – synthetic market data generation and scenario testing.
* **Graph Algorithms** – network-based market structure analysis and portfolio optimization.
* **Statistical & Econometric Models** – regime-switching, factor modeling, and predictive analytics.
